# Employee Time Management Prototype
Group project 2.2 - Mobile application that allows employees to clock in and out when they're on location

This project was part of a group project at Avans University, year 2, period 2. The goal was to create a prototype mobile application for a real company that allows employees to log in and keep track of their worked hours. 

This is the back-end of the prototype, made using NodeJS and MySQL
